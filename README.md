# Mussel Info App

An educational app that contains information on the  unionidae endemic to North Carolina.

## Why Freshwater Mussels?

Freshwater mussels, or bivalve mollusks, hereafter referred to as mussels, are a vital part of freshwater ecosystems across the American Southeast. Of the 297 documented taxa of mussels in North America, about two-thirds of them are designated as threatened or endangered. Mussels fill an important ecological niche as filter feeders littered across the bed of lotic systems. As a sedentary species, mussels lack the ability to avoid ecological disturbances. The Southeast has experienced explosive growth over the last decade leading to serious alterations to the watersheds. Dams are exceptionally problematic for local mussel assemblages because they convert lotic systems into lentic systems. The conversion to lentic systems causes habitat fragmentation and changes in sediment loading. The changes to the natural hydrology of the streams have various negative effects on mussels from clogging gills to disruptions in reproductive processes. Increased awareness about the detrimental impacts of dams on lotic systems has led to movements to remove old ones no longer in use. However, dam removals have been shown to have various negative immediate effects on stream systems. Mussel propagation has also been explored as an option to support struggling mussel populations with various levels of success. Mussels are vital to freshwater streams; their decline in population will cause declines in stream water quality along with potential unforeseen consequences.
